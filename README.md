# ZeroChat - ZeroNet 'Getting Started'

This repository serves as the results of following the [**ZeroChat 'Getting Started'** guide](https://decentralize.today/decentralized-p2p-chat-in-100-lines-of-code-d6e496034cd4), and attempting the other suggestions provided at the end of the article.
[Read on ZeroNet](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post:99:ZeroChat+tutorial).

## Notes
If you're going to follow the tutorial, make sure to remove publishing any of your private information!
They'll typically be in `content.json` files.
For the purposes of the repository, the `content.json` files have been replaced with `content-example.json` files, with appropriate fields scrubbed out.
If you follow the tutorial, yours will be properly filled out.
Also, removed `/data/zerochat.db` and replaced with empty `/data/zerochat-example.db`

## Challenges / TODO
- ~~Display message time~~
- ~~Move source code to separate .js file~~
